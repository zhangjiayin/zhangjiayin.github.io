## Implementing MVC in PHP: The Model

This article series (starting with [<font color="#800080">Understanding MVC in PHP</font>](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2005/09/15/mvc_intro.html) and continued in [<font color="#800080">Implementing MVC in PHP: The Controller</font>](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2005/11/03/mvc_controller.html) and [<font color="#800080">Implementing MVC in PHP: The View</font>](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2006/01/26/mvc_view.html)) demonstrates how to build an MVC web framework using PHP 5. This article explains the Model part of Model-View-Controller design.

The Model is where the majority of the application's logic sits. It is where you run queries against the database and perform calculations on input. A good example of what a Model would look like is a simple login script. The login script gets user input from a form, validates it against the database, and then logs in the user.

The first application using the newly created framework will be the `users` module. I will be creating three Models:

- _login.php_ validates input from a form against the database
- _logout.php_ logs a user out and destroys the associated session
- _whoami.php_ displays simple user information, similar to the Unix program of the same name

Because I am introducing the idea of sessions and users into the framework, I will need to create a few more foundation classes as well as a table in a database. Before I go over the code of _login.php_, I'd like to walk through these classes.

### `FR_Session`

`FR_Session` is a wrapper for the built-in PHP sessions. The code isn't very involved and provides only basic support for starting, destroying, and writing sessions.
